# Azure AI POC

Here I am uploading the sample code I used to connect with Azure API to try out some AI features...

It's done with typescript and I executed without building the .ts file by installing `tsx` globally

```
$ npm install tsx -g
```

then, install project dependencies:

```
# npm install
```

and execute with:

```
tsx main.ts
```

Important: You must replace values on `main.ts` with your Azure credentials. And if you want to use the Use Case of imagesUrls, you must also provide the links inside the array.
